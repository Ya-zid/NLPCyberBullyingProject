# NLP Cyberbullying Detection Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a **team project** focused on detecting cyberbullying in the algerian dialect using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages machine learning models and data preprocessing methods to analyze text data and classify it as cyberbullying or not.

## Project Overview

The project is implemented in Python and includes a Jupyter Notebook (`NLP_project_final_notebook.ipynb`) that demonstrates the end-to-end workflow, including:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements various models for classification.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights into the data and model performance through visualizations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
